ArcanumPy Documentation
=======================

.. _arpy: https://qudsiramiz.space/arcanumpy/

ArcanumPy is a Python package that provides a set of tools that I have developed for my research or
have found useful in my research. The package is named after the Ars Arcanum, in the Stormlight
Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. The Ars Arcanum is a collection of information about the magic
systems in the world of Roshar.

.. note::

    The package is still under development and might be a bit buggy to use. Please report any bug
    that you might find to us. The documentation is also a work in progress and is being continuously updated.
