About ArcanumPy
================

ArcanumPy is a Python package that provides a set of tools that I have developed for my research or
have found useful in my research. The package is named after the Ars Arcanum, in the Stormlight
Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. The Ars Arcanum is a collection of information about the magic
systems in the world of Roshar.
