A python package of random functions and classes that I use in my projects. This package is a work in
progress and will be updated as I add more functions and classes to it.

# Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install arcanumpy
```

Visit the [documentation](https://qudsiramiz.space/arcanumpy/) for more information on how to use the
package.
